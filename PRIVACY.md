Last Updated: 05/14/2024

## Introduction

SnapStats is a Chrome extension designed to provide users with performance metrics for websites. This privacy policy explains what information we collect and how it is used.

## Information Collection and Use

SnapStats collects the following information:

- **Performance Metrics**: The extension measures performance metrics (TTFB, FCP, LCP, CLS, etc.) of the websites you visit, but only when you explicitly click the "Run Audit" button.
- **Resource Information**: Information about resources loaded by the current page is collected, including file names, types, sizes, and load times.
- **Historical Data**: The extension stores your previous performance measurement data locally in your browser's storage.

All data collected by SnapStats is stored **locally** on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not transmit any data to external servers, and we do not use any tracking or analytics services.

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: To access and analyze the current tab's performance metrics
- **scripting**: To run performance measurement scripts on the current page
- **storage**: To store historical performance data locally

## Data Sharing

We do not share any of your data with third parties. All information collected remains on your local device.

## Data Retention

Performance history is limited to the most recent measurements and is stored only on your local device. You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser's extension storage.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on the Chrome Web Store.
