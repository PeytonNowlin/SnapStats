**SnapStats is the operating system for web performance.** It transforms raw browser telemetry into critical decision advantage, empowering engineers to dissect, analyze, and optimize the digital infrastructure that powers user experience.

In an era where milliseconds dictate engagement, visibility is the precursor to victory. SnapStats provides a comprehensive operational picture of your web application's performance, integrating Core Web Vitals with granular resource intelligence to expose hidden latencies and structural inefficiencies.

## // CORE CAPABILITIES

### VITAL TELEMETRY
Capture high-fidelity signals across the performance spectrum. Monitor **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**, **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**, and **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** with precision. Transform abstract metrics into a unified view of user experience health.

### INFRASTRUCTURE RECONNAISSANCE
Deconstruct the network layer. Analyze resource distribution, payload weight, and request cascades. Identify bottlenecks in the supply chain of your application's delivery.

### DECISION INTELLIGENCE
Move beyond observation to action. SnapStats synthesizes performance data into actionable directives. Leverage color-coded thresholds and historical tracking to drive continuous optimization cycles and secure SEO dominance.

### SOVEREIGN ARCHITECTURE
Security is foundational. SnapStats operates on a strictly **local-first protocol**. No external transmission. No third-party surveillance. Your performance data remains exclusively within your control.
